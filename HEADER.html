<h2>Jer's little code playground</h2>

<p>Here you'll find various bits and peices of code usually in C and Perl, somewhat disorganized, very 
disparate, often bitrotting.  This is updated automatically from CVS, so no guarantees on the new stuff either.  
Each sub-folder should have a bit more info on it's contents.  If it's not useful, hopefully at least it's 
eductational.  BTW, my coding style is frequently poorly documented, and swings between careless 
verbosity and painful efficiency/compactness, you've been forewarned :)</p>
